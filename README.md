# # Attendance App
The Attendance App is a powerful tool designed to streamline and automate the process of taking attendance for students. This app works offline and handles the attendance data directly from the Excel files you upload. All changes made during the attendance process are saved directly to the original Excel file, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.

This app can handle multiple files simultaneously and stores all data locally without requiring an internet connection or cloud storage, making it an ideal solution for environments with limited or no internet access.

## Features
Offline Functionality: Works entirely offline, without the need for cloud storage or an internet connection.
Multiple File Handling: Allows users to upload and manage multiple Excel files at once.
Direct Excel Integration: The app is tightly integrated with Excel files. Any changes made to the attendance data are directly reflected in the Excel file.
Real-Time Updates: All changes, such as marking attendance, are saved immediately to the original Excel file, ensuring that no data is lost.
Manual or Automated Updates: The app offers flexibility to manually update attendance or save the updated Excel file at any time.
Data Security: Since the app works locally and does not rely on cloud storage, your data is stored securely on your device.
## How It Works
Uploading Excel Files:

The app allows you to upload multiple Excel files (spreadsheet format .xlsx) that contain the student records.
Once the files are uploaded, you can view and interact with the data.
Taking Attendance:

Select the relevant student(s) or class from the list.
Mark students as "Present" or "Absent" using the app's simple interface.
You can easily track and update the attendance for each student, session by session.
Saving Changes:

Any changes you make, such as marking attendance or updating student records, are saved directly to the original Excel file.
You can choose to save the changes at any point in the process, or let the app automatically update the Excel file after every change.
The updated Excel file can be downloaded or stored locally on your system at any time.
Managing Multiple Files:

You can manage and view multiple attendance Excel files at the same time. The app provides an easy-to-use interface for switching between files or handling multiple classes' attendance data.
No Internet Required:

The app is fully functional without requiring any internet connection, making it perfect for use in offline environments or areas with unreliable connectivity.
Usage Instructions
Uploading Files:

On the main interface, click the Upload button to select the Excel files you want to work with.
The app supports uploading multiple files simultaneously.
Marking Attendance:

Once your file is uploaded, the attendance data will be displayed on the screen.
Use the buttons or checkboxes next to each student’s name to mark them as "Present" or "Absent".
You can update attendance for different dates or sessions based on the structure of your Excel file.
Saving and Downloading the Updated File:

Once you’ve made all the necessary changes to the attendance data, you can save the changes back to the original Excel file.
You can also download the updated Excel file to store it locally.
Real-Time Saving:

The app saves all changes in real-time as soon as you mark attendance, so you don’t have to worry about losing data.
File Structure and Format
Excel File Format:
The app works with Excel files where attendance data is typically stored in tabular format. The app expects the following structure:

Columns:

Student Name: The name of the student.
Roll Number: A unique identifier for the student.
Multiple Sheets: If your file contains multiple sheets (e.g., for different classes or subjects), the app will let you manage them separately.




## Advantages of Using the Attendance App
Time-Saving: The app automates the attendance marking process, allowing you to quickly mark attendance for all students in multiple classes or sessions.
Data Integrity: By saving changes directly to the Excel file, you ensure that the data is always up-to-date and consistent.
No Need for Internet: Since the app works offline, you can use it in environments where internet access is not available or is unreliable.
Multiple File Management: You can work with multiple Excel files simultaneously, which is ideal for teachers handling multiple classes or subjects.
Security: Since the app stores data locally, you retain full control over your files, ensuring privacy and security.
